Django's Way of Running a Server:

vi commands

 then write the file and quit with :wq<Enter>)

Django's Way of Creating an App:
python manage.py startapp "NameOfApp"
(Django encourages you to structure your code into apps: 
the theory is that one project can have many apps, 
you can use third-party apps developed by other people, 
and you might even reuse one of your own apps in a different project)

python:
we have the if __name__ == '__main__' clause (if you’ve not seen it before, that’s how a Python script checks
 if it’s been executed from the command line, rather than just imported by another script). 
 We call unittest.main(), which launches the unittest test runner, which will automatically find test classes
 and methods in the file and run them.
